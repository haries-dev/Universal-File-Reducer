# Universal File Reducer

The **Universal File Reducer** is a Python-based tool that allows users to compress images, PDFs, Word documents, and Excel files while adding a watermark for identification. Designed for local use, this application ensures your sensitive data remains private and secure, eliminating the need to upload files to online services.

## Key Features

- **Local Processing**: Compress files without uploading them online, maintaining your privacy and control over your sensitive data.
- **Multiple File Formats**: Supports various file types, including images (PNG, JPG), PDFs, Word documents, and Excel spreadsheets.
- **Custom Watermark**: Add a personalized watermark to your files during compression for easy identification.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple graphical interface that allows users to select and compress files easily.

## Changelog

### v1.1
- Removed licensing code for a streamlined experience.
- Improved image processing for better compression.
- Enhanced GUI layout for easier file selection.
- Added functionality to handle unsupported file formats gracefully.

### v1.0
- Initial release with basic file compression features.

## Why Use This Tool?

Unlike online file compressors that might keep a copy of your data, **Universal File Reducer** processes files locally on your machine. This is particularly useful when working with confidential or private data.
